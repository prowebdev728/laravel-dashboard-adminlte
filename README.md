Laravel 5.3, MySQL, AdminLTE (Dashboard Template)

Fix bugs
Add new pages
Modify various functions

1. There is always a message on the top of dashboard:
   "Please confirm your email for getting submission notifications. Your account will deactivate in case it will not confirm in a week."
   I haven't received any confirmation email. Is the email function working fine?

2. On dashboard the links: "Pending Request", "Approved Articles", "Used Articles" are dead/missing/leads no where. Need to fix these links, they should lead to perticular pages.

3. On Dashboard, there should be a box of "rejected articles" too, which will contain the articles rejected by the admin.

4. In the Article tab, there should be a column of "Editor", so that we can instantly see who wrote this article.

5. In the composer, plz remove the words limits from title, summary and composer.

6. In composer, adding picture disturbs content and count of "number of words", need fix.

7. In composer, we should be able to extract the source of image that is added in the "compose" section.

8. We need a new section, "keywords" under the "summary" section,

9. "Writer" should be able to add a specific category from his/her interface.

10. We need a new role for the website. NAme will be "Editor". Editor should be able to add new articles, delete old articles, approve or reject articles.

11. Any post which is under pending, gets deleted after a week. Please remove this feature as we want our pending content to be in pending until its approved, rejected or removed.

12. On Admin Dashboard, there should be a box which will mention how many posts are written by a specific user this week.
